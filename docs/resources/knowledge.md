# devin_knowledge (Resource)

This resource manages knowledge resources in the Devin API. A knowledge resource includes a name, body content, trigger description, and an optional parent folder ID.

Knowledge resources provide a way to supply information to the Devin AI system, which is triggered under specific conditions to generate appropriate responses.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "devin_knowledge" "example" {
  name                = "Sample Knowledge"
  body                = "This is a sample knowledge created with Terraform"
  trigger_description = "This knowledge is triggered under specific conditions"
}
```

### Knowledge Resource in a Folder

```terraform
resource "devin_knowledge" "folder_example" {
  name                = "Knowledge in Folder"
  body                = "This is a knowledge resource placed in a folder"
  trigger_description = "Example of organizing knowledge in a folder structure"
  parent_folder_id    = "folder-123"
}
```

### Knowledge Resource with Multiline Content

```terraform
resource "devin_knowledge" "multiline_example" {
  name                = "Multiline Knowledge"
  body                = <<EOT

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
EOT
  trigger_description = "Example of knowledge with multiline rich content"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) - The name of the knowledge resource. Set a clear and unique name for easy identification.
- `body` (String) - The content of the knowledge resource. Include any necessary information, such as text, markdown, or code snippets.
- `trigger_description` (String) - The trigger description for the knowledge resource. This describes the scenarios in which this knowledge should be triggered.

### Optional

- `parent_folder_id` (String) - The ID of the parent folder. Used to organize knowledge in folders.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) - The unique ID of the knowledge resource generated by the Devin API.

## Attribute Details

### name

The name of the knowledge resource should be concise and descriptive for easy management. This name is displayed in the Devin UI and used to identify the knowledge resource.

### body

The body of the knowledge resource contains the actual information that Devin AI will use. This is text in markdown format and can include code snippets, tables, lists, headers, and more.

### trigger_description

The trigger description indicates in what situations the knowledge should be used. This is used by Devin AI to determine when to apply the knowledge.

### parent_folder_id

The parent folder ID is used to organize knowledge resources hierarchically. This is optional, and if not specified, the knowledge will be placed at the root level.

## Import

This resource can be imported using its ID. To manage an existing knowledge resource with Terraform, use the following command:

```shell
terraform import devin_knowledge.example knowledge_id_123
```

After importing, you can run `terraform plan` to see the differences between the actual resource state and your Terraform configuration. You can then update your Terraform configuration to match the actual resource state.

# devin Provider

The Devin provider is used to interact with the [Devin API](https://api.devin.ai) resources. It allows you to manage knowledge resources as infrastructure as code, enabling version-controlled configuration of AI knowledge.

This provider supports creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting knowledge resources, providing a way to programmatically maintain information that Devin's AI can access and use.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    devin = {
      source  = "hirosi1900day/devin"
      version = "~> 0.0.5"
    }
  }
}

provider "devin" {
  api_key = var.devin_api_key  # このAPIキーは環境変数から取得できます
}

variable "devin_api_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "Devin API Key"
  sensitive   = true
}
```

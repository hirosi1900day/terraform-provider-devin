## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use the GitHub Security Advisory feature rather than GitHub Issues to report it. This allows us to assess the impact of the vulnerability and prepare a fix.

Please select "Security" tab in the project's GitHub repository, then "Advisories" â†’ "New draft security advisory" and fill in the details of the vulnerability.

Reported vulnerabilities will be addressed through the following process:

1. Acknowledgment of the reported vulnerability
2. Verification and impact assessment
3. Development of a fix
4. Release of a new version
5. Public disclosure (at an appropriate time)

Thank you for your cooperation.
